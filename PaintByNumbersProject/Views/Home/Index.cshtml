    <p>This web application is a project developed by Clemson Students in the class “Software Development Methodology” in 2022.

The project consists of a web application developed in Asp.Net Core 6 MVC in which the user will have the opportunity to learn or improve their coloring skills. This project offers different options to the user, from a daily random painting to a specific picture from the catalog in the app. It is required to register with an email account to access all data and compete against other people worldwide. The site provides a graph showing the top ten scoring users.

The scoring will depend on the time the user takes to finish the coloring task and the complexity of the drawing.</p>
